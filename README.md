# Erdos-2021-text-classifier-public-comments
Repository for the Erdos Data Science Bootcamp final project.

Description and motivation: this project aims to become a tool for organizations and researchers looking to sinthesize highly-technical information from public federal documents (public comments to federal climate change regulations) via suppervised classification in which the target is a feature present in the text. Feature in this context means a relevant policy-oriented argument the sender of the comment includes in the text. For example, one relevant feature is the legal authority of the federal agency to develop such regulation. A supervised classifier can be trained and tested in a hand-labeled subset of all available comments (raging from 2 to 100s of pages) to later be extended to unlabeled texts, thus scaling up human effort enormously.

Data: the data to replicate these results are contained in the following folder: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0jfcdpa6osw8laq/AACu3zyD3cKrfdhXQtlZZudXa?dl=0
